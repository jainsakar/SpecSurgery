this is a platform where we can go and compare the price of a surgery in different hospitals
So I have built a website that can serve the purpose, the information about the hospital’s staff, their qualification, year of establishment of hospital, facilities, how experienced the doctors are, cost of surgery, number of court cases registered so far etc. all these factors are taken into account to categorise which hospital is the :

  •	Best in treatment ignoring expenses
  •	Least expensive
  •	Average treatment as well as expenses

As this website is just a working model I have only taken into account two surgeries:
  •	Bypass Surgery
  •	Kidney Transplant

But we can add more surgeries per hospital, as well we can store information of some new hospitals which are not on our website by accessing the admin panel, which is very simply designed UI where we can add details of new hospitals, edit details of pre-existing hospitals as well as add new surgeries inside a hospital.
This website also has a working feedback and confession portion where user can provide feedback for the treatment they receive in the hospitals across Delhi.
Apart from this a secure user authentication is also provided, for both doctors and patients separately.
The website also holds many other interesting portions, on which I am still working like 
Online Clinic where the patients can consult doctor online in some minimal charges which are much less then what they have to pay to consult a doctor physically, the online treatment can be from video conferencing or simply through texting. Free consultancy is also provided where the doctors as well normal people can answer the queries of patients.
